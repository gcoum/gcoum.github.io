	<p class="pb-3">
	  Hello!
	</p>
	<p class="pb-3">
	  My name's Geoff and I’m currently looking for a career change out of IT and getting a toehold
	  in the electrical field, I'm on the hunt for an opportunity as a mature aged
	  apprentice or a TA.
	</p>
	<p class="pb-3">
	As part of the career change effort I’ve completed a Certificate II in
Electrotechnology. I have a QLD Manual Driver’s License, a White Card, a car, live on
the Sunshine Coast in Tewantin, work well in team environments and am quick to
	learn.
	</p>

	<p class="pb-3">
	  <a href="#work-history">My background has mostly been software</a>, some of which were in electrical companies. Recently I've finished a stint at
	  a tier 1 electrical contractor, Fredon in Brisbane, working alongside electricians to develop energy reporting software
	  for a solar power saving initiative. Adjacent to that was interfacing with SCADA systems for lighting control which
	  used Dali and Modbus protocols. Despite that <a href="#work-experience" class="underline text-blue-800">I've have
	  had some work experience</a> working directly with electrical, at TAFE and at a brewery, which I've found I really enjoy.
	</p>

	<p class="pb-3">
Also in the past I’ve worked as a communications tech at a company called Ezi
Communications where I was working along side electricians & other tradespeople —
running data cabling in drop ceilings along catenary wire, using snakes to fish out
paths through conduit, rough-ins and fit-outs for new timber frame rooms at the
office, working with hammer drills for various fixings, conduit and antenna mounts.
It was good to be on the tools.
	</p>
	<p class="pb-3">
	  If you know of anyone who could put me to use as an apprentice or electrical TA please forward my details along and
	  I'll shout you a carton or bottle of whatever you'd like.
	</p>
	<p class="">
	  Cheers,
	</p>
	<p class="pb-3">
	  Geoff
