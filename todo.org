As part of the career change effort I’ve completed a Certificate II in
Electrotechnology. I have a QLD Manual Driver’s License, a White Card, a car, live on
the Sunshine Coast in Tewantin, work well in team environments and am quick to
learn.
In the past I’ve worked as a communications tech at a company called Ezi
Communications where I was working along side electricians & other tradespeople —
running data cabling in drop ceilings along catenary wire, using snakes to fish out
paths through conduit, rough-ins and fit-outs for new timber frame rooms at the
office, working with hammer drills for various fixings, conduit and antenna mounts —
and enjoyed it a lot.
Less directly related to practical trade skills but perhaps still relevant; I also worked
at an electrical manufacturer who designed and built high voltage plugs for the
mining industry, which exposed me to electrical concepts and the fun (and
seriousness) of working in a regulated environment with legal standards.
I’m available to start immediately, hope to hear from you,
